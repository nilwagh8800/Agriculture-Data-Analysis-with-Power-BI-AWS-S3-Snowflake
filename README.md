# Project Overview
This project analyzes rainfall, temperature, humidity, and crop yield data to uncover insights into agricultural productivity. 

Using AWS S3 for storage, Snowflake for querying, and Power BI for visualization, we provide key insights for farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders in the agriculture industry.

# Tech Stack
Cloud Storage: AWS S3

Data Warehouse: Snowflake

Query Language: SQL

Data Visualization: Power BI

# Key Analyses

# Yield Analysis
Metric: Average Crop Yield

Breakdowns: By Year, Season, Crop, and Location

Key Insights:

Certain seasons produced higher yields due to ideal temperature and rainfall.
Regional differences in yield highlight the impact of soil quality and climate.
Specific crops thrive in different locations based on environmental factors.

# Temperature Analysis

Metric: Average Temperature (Â°C)

Breakdowns: By Year, Season, Crop, and Location

Key Insights:

Some regions experience higher temperature fluctuations, impacting sensitive crops.

Seasonal temperature variations play a key role in determining planting and harvesting periods.

Helps farmers choose temperature-resilient crops for better productivity.

# Rainfall Analysis

Metric: Average Rainfall (mm)

Breakdowns: By Year, Season, Crop, and Location

Key Insights:

Monsoon seasons significantly impact water-intensive crops.

Regions with low rainfall require better irrigation planning.

Rainfall fluctuations influence seasonal crop yield and farming cycles.

# Humidity Analysis

Metric: Average Humidity (%)

Breakdowns: By Year, Season, Crop, and Location

Key Insights:

High humidity levels increase disease risks in certain crops.

Dry seasons with low humidity impact crop moisture retention and growth.

Helps in predicting climate impact on future farming practices.

# Final Insights

ðŸ”¹ Combining all four factors helps in understanding optimal farming conditions.

ðŸ”¹ Farmers can adapt their crop choices based on seasonal weather trends.

ðŸ”¹ Data-driven strategies help improve yield forecasting and sustainable farming.

# Project Workflow

Data Ingestion: Stored CSV files in AWS S3

Data Processing: Queried and analyzed data in Snowflake

Data Visualization: Created Power BI dashboards with interactive charts

# How to Run This Project

Upload the CSV files to an AWS S3 bucket.

Use Snowflake to create external tables and run SQL queries.

Connect Power BI to Snowflake and create visualizations.

# Insights & Conclusion

Rainfall & Humidity: High rainfall and humidity correlate with increased crop yield in certain regions.

Temperature Trends: Extreme temperatures negatively impact productivity.

Data-Driven Decisions: Helps farmers choose the best time to plant crops for maximum yield.
