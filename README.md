# Project Overview
This project analyzes rainfall, temperature, humidity, and crop yield data to uncover insights into agricultural productivity. 

Using AWS S3 for storage, Snowflake for querying, and Power BI for visualization, we provide key insights for farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders in the agriculture industry.

# Tech Stack
Cloud Storage: AWS S3

Data Warehouse: Snowflake

Query Language: SQL

Data Visualization: Power BI

# Key Analyses

# Rainfall Analysis
Monthly and yearly rainfall trends

Impact of rainfall on crop yield

Comparison of rainfall across regions

# Temperature Analysis

Seasonal temperature variations

Correlation between temperature and yield

Identifying extreme temperature impacts

# Humidity Analysis

Humidity trends over time

Relationship between humidity and crop production

Impact of high/low humidity on different crops

# Yield Analysis

Crop yield comparison by region

Influence of climatic factors on productivity

Identifying the most favorable conditions for high yield

# Project Workflow

Data Ingestion: Stored CSV files in AWS S3

Data Processing: Queried and analyzed data in Snowflake

Data Visualization: Created Power BI dashboards with interactive charts

# How to Run This Project

Upload the CSV files to an AWS S3 bucket.

Use Snowflake to create external tables and run SQL queries.

Connect Power BI to Snowflake and create visualizations.

# Insights & Conclusion

Rainfall & Humidity: High rainfall and humidity correlate with increased crop yield in certain regions.

Temperature Trends: Extreme temperatures negatively impact productivity.

Data-Driven Decisions: Helps farmers choose the best time to plant crops for maximum yield.
